##  AI Car Racing
 by Kevin Sandke

### 1. Does it include the clear overview on what the project is about? (4/4)
The goal is to train a PPO model with CNN for processing data and decision-making in the Car Racing environment, motivated by the author's interest in Formula 1 and motorsports.
### 2. Does it explain how the environment works and what the game rules are? (4/4)
The Car Racing environment is explained, including the goal (completing randomly generated tracks quickly without leaving the track), action space (steering, gas, brake controls), observation space (RGB pixel array), reward function (tile visiting rewards and time penalties), and episode termination conditions.
### 3. Does it explain clearly the model(s) of choices, the methods and purpose of tests and experiments? (7/7)
The PPO model with CNN architecture is explained with detailed neural network structure. Data preprocessing methods convert RGB frames to grayscale, stack consecutive frames for temporal information, and normalize pixel values. The CNN feature extractor with three convolutional layers feeds into parallel actor-critic networks. The PPO learning process is explained step-by-step.
### 4. Does it show problem solving procedure- e.g. how the author solved and improved when an algorithm doesn't work well... (7/7)
The report shows an iterative improvement process starting with basic implementation, then adding vectorized environments for faster training, addressing training instabilities with gradient clipping and learning rate schedulers, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. The training loop method is documented with specific examples of identified problems and solutions, like adding smooth steering rewards when the car was turning erratically.
### 5. Does it include the results summary, interpretation of experiments and visualization (e.g. performance comparison table, graphs etc)? (7/7)
Results include detailed performance metrics with graphs comparing random agent baseline and two trained models. The analysis covers mean rewards, maximum scores, and quartile distributions with visualizations. The report interprets performance differences between models, noting how reducing off-track penalties improved consistency but lowered maximum performance.
### 6. Does it include discussion and suggestions for improvements or future work? (5/5)
The conclusion discusses satisfaction with results while acknowledging areas for improvement. Specific suggestions include better balancing penalties to combine the floor of the consistent model with the ceiling of the higher-performing model, taking wheel positioning into account, and continuing to refine reward shaping parameters.
### 7. Does it include all deliverables? (3/3)
The report includes a GitHub repository link, YouTube playlist of demonstration videos, proper citations and references to related work, and comprehensive documentation of implementation details.
### 8. Is the writeup well organized overall? Overall writeup quality. (3/3)
The report is excellently structured with clear sections from overview through conclusion. Technical details are explained at appropriate depth, visualizations support conclusions, and the problem-solving narrative provides insight into the development process.
