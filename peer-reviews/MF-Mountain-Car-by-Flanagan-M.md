##  MF-Mountain-Car
 by Maci Flanagan


### 1. Does it include the clear overview on what the project is about? (4/4)
The goal of the project is to build and test a Q-learning agent for the MountainCar environment using the Gymnasium library. 
### 2. Does it explain how the environment works and what the game rules are? (4/4)
MountainCar-v0 environment is explained with its state space (position and velocity) and action space (push left, right, or do nothing). The challenge of continuous state values is highlighted as requiring discretization for tabular Q-learning.
### 3. Does it explain clearly the model(s) of choices, the methods and purpose of tests and experiments? (7/7)
Q-learning with discrete state representation is used. The approach includes dividing position and velocity into 20 bins each, creating a 20x20 grid of states. The Q-table setup, initialization to zero, and epsilon-greedy exploration strategy with decay are all explained clearly.
### 4. Does it show problem solving procedure- e.g. how the author solved and improved when an algorithm doesn't work well... (4/7)
Some problem solving is shown, including discretization decisions and exploration decay rate tuning. However, the report lacks detailed iterations of attempts or specific adjustments made when facing challenges. The rendering issue solution is mentioned but without much detail on the troubleshooting process.
### 5. Does it include the results summary, interpretation of experiments and visualization (e.g. performance comparison table, graphs etc)? (5/7)
Results include learning progress metrics from starting performance to final average reward. A reward curve plot is mentioned but only appears in the python notebook. The report lacks detailed analysis of what specific settings worked best or comparative results between different approaches.
### 6. Does it include discussion and suggestions for improvements or future work? (5/5)
Discussion includes what worked well (discretization and exploration decay). Challenges are identified (slow training, sparse rewards). Future work suggestions include finer discretization, using DQN to avoid discretization entirely, and implementing reward shaping.
### 7. Does it include all deliverables? (2/3)
The writeup is included, but there's no repository. A training plot is also mentioned, but it only appears in the python notebook. There is one gif provided.
### 8. Is the writeup well organized overall? Overall writeup quality. (2/3)
The writeup has structure with an overview, approach, results, and conclusion section. The writing is accessible with decent explainations of technical concepts. However, a text document is a huge and unecesaary limitation on formatting and visualizations.
